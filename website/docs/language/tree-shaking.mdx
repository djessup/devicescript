# Tree-shaking

**This is currently disabled.**
We may [add it back in future](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues/332) with an optional annotation on the `Foo` class below.

Care needs to be taken when using index operator (`obj[some_expression]`)
or accessing properties through `any` type
as some properties might be tree-shaken away.
You can use `ds.keep()` function to make sure methods are included.

```ts
class Foo {
    bar() {}
}
function callBar(v: any) {
    v["bar"]()
}
callBar(new Foo())

// can be called anywhere from the reachable code
ds.keep(Foo.prototype.bar)
```

We may improve compiler warnings about such cases in future.

See [discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/discussions/36).
